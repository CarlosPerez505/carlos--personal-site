        <b>About me:</b>
        This section will detail my professional history, core skill set, and professional highlights.<br/> This section will showcase my strengths and personality. I will display badges of all the technologies <br/> and languages I am experienced with at a glance. The tone of voice will be personable and casual, <br/> as I am only interested in opportunities with individuals and organizations that I am a good <br/> personality fit for.

        <b>Portfolio:</b>
        I want this to be an animated if possible, responsive image gallery containing my milestone<br/> project I did in bootcamp and will include my role and contributions to each project and the <br/>technology used.
