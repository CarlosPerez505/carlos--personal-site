       who is looking to hire a promising jr full stack developer to join his startup. Mike just lost <br/>

       Windows 11 Pro and his S21 Ultra running Android 11 with unlimited 5G connection.
   </p>

   <p>
       <b>Attitudes and Behaviors:</b>
       Mike likes to handpick his own employees because he expects to build a strong team and do his<br/>
       best to retain them. He wants to find someone who is going to grow with the startup and stay<br/>
       for a few years. In order to do that he stays very competitive with the labor market compensation<br/>
       rates. He has a habit of browsing Linkdln, Twitter and Indeed looking for jr devs and mid-level<br/>
       developers with a history of long term employment.

   <p>
       <b>Frustrations and Needs:</b>
       Mike Doesn't have time to waste they are on a deadline to get their product to market as soon<br/>
       as possible so he's looking for a junior full stack dev with some experience he can take under<br/>
       his wing to help deploy their site and teach them how to make smart contracts. He is also<br/>
       looking for someone who has skills working remotely because he doesn't have time to<br/>
       waste relocating someone half the country away and understands that talent can come from<br/>.
       anywhere. He needs someone with a  history of long term employment and willing to learn new <br/>
       new tech like Solidity.
